<p>Elasticsearch installations can be configured to allow REST API access without any type of authentication.
    The app therefore marks <b>username</b> and <b>password</b> as optional parameters. If specified, the app
    will end up using these for generating the basic authentication header used in the various Elasticsearch
    REST endpoints.<br>Connection can be configured over HTTP or HTTPS, so if <b>test connectivity</b>
    fails please check the protocol.

    Action parameter has been removed to the action given below. Hence, It is requested to the end-user please update their existing playbooks parameters to ensure the correct functioning
    of the playbooks created on the earlier versions of the app.
