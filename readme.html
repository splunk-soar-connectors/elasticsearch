<p>Elasticsearch installations can be configured to allow REST API access without any type of authentication. The app therefore marks <b>username</b> and <b>password</b> as optional parameters. If specified, the app will end up using these for generating the basic authentication header used in the various Elasticsearch REST endpoints.<br>Connection can be configured over HTTP or HTTPS, so if <b>test connectivity</b> fails please check the protocol.</p>
