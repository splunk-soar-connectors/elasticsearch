<p>Elasticsearch installations can be configured to allow REST API access without any type of authentication.
    The app therefore marks <b>username</b> and <b>password</b> as optional parameters. If specified, the app
    will use these for generating the basic authentication header for various Elasticsearch
    REST endpoints.<br>The connection can be configured over HTTP or HTTPS, so if <b>test connectivity</b>
    fails please check the protocol.
</p>
<p><b>Playbook Backward Compatibility</b><br>
    An action parameter has been changed as detailed below. Hence, it is recommended that the end-user update their existing playbooks parameters accordingly to ensure that playbooks created using earlier versions of the app are functioning correctly.
